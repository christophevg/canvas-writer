Small HTML5 Canvas library for hand-written fonts and exchange of messages  
author: Christophe VG <contact@christophe.vg>

# Introduction

Using CanvasWriter you can record and replay things you draw on an HTML5 Canvas element. It's completely self-contained and doesn't use any external libraries.

# Record & Play

In its most basic form, that's what it does. Open `examples/record-play.html` in a browser (only Safari is tested right now), push the `record` button and draw something inside the left rectangle on the screen. When done, push the `stop` button and watch CanvasWriter _write_. In the Javascript console, the recorded data is logged.
